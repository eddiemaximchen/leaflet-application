# traveling with leaflet

use map.py and addCityToState.py to make my own maps.<br>
index.html--it can take only one jsonfile and html page and you can click on every state and every city without changing pages.<br>
route.html--I found it in the internet and it can calculate the distance and router if you give it start and end point. very cool!!
